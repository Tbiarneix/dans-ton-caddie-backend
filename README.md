# Setup

Install dependencies :
npm install

Copy the environnement variables :
cp .env.sample .env

This `.env` file allows to change the way the Node server connects to the database, but you probably won't have to change any of those variables unless you want to deploy the app yourself or connect it to a specific DB.


### Run the app

npm run dev
